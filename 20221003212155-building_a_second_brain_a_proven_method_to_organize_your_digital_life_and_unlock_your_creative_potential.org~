#1
The practice of writing down one’s thoughts and notes to help make sense of the world has a long legacy. For centuries, artists and intellectuals from Leonardo da Vinci to Virginia Woolf, from John Locke to Octavia Butler, have recorded the ideas they found most interesting in a book they carried around with them, known as a “commonplace book.

#2
Once our notes and observations become digital, they can be searched, organized and synced across all our devices, and backed up to the cloud for safekeeping.
2022-09-10
#3
This digital commonplace book is what I call a Second Brain. Think of it as the combination of a study notebook, a personal journal, and a sketchbook for new ideas.
2022-09-10

Second Brain is a private knowledge collection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single use case. It is a laboratory where you can develop and refine your thinking in solitude before sharing it with others. A studio where you can experiment with ideas until they are ready to be put to use in the outside world. A whiteboard where you can sketch out your ideas and collaborate on them with others.
2022-09-10
#5
a note is a “knowledge building block”—a discrete unit of information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head.
2022-09-10
#6
A knowledge building block is discrete. It stands on its own and has intrinsic value, but knowledge building blocks can also be combined into something much greater—a report, an argument, a proposal, a story.
2022-09-10
#7
Before we do anything with our ideas, we have to “off-load” them from our minds and put them into concrete form. Only when we declutter our brain of complex ideas can we think clearly and start to work with those ideas effectively.
2022-09-11
#8
In its most practical form, creativity is about connecting ideas together, especially ideas that don’t seem to be connected.
2022-09-11
#9
This tendency is known as recency bias.4 We tend to favor the ideas, solutions, and influences that occurred to us most recently, regardless of whether they are the best ones.
2022-09-11
#10
the ultimate purpose of a Second Brain is to allow your own thinking to shine.

#17
there are three stages of progress I often observe—and even encourage. Those stages are remembering, connecting, and creating.
2022-09-11
#18
The first way that people tend to use their Second Brain is as a memory aid.
2022-09-11
#19
The second way that people use their Second Brain is to connect ideas together.
2022-09-11
#20
the third and final way that people use their Second Brain is for creating new things.
2022-09-11
#21
To guide you in the process of creating your own Second Brain, I’ve developed a simple, intuitive four-part method called “CODE”—Capture; Organize; Distill; Express.
2022-09-11
#22
goal should be to “capture” only the ideas and insights we think are truly noteworthy.
2022-09-11
#23
The solution is to keep only what resonates in a trusted place that you control, and to leave the rest aside.
2022-09-11
#24
just look inside for a feeling of pleasure, curiosity, wonder, or excitement, and let that be your signal for when it’s time to capture a passage, an image, a quote, or a fact.
2022-09-11
#25
The best way to organize your notes is to organize for action, according to the active projects you are working on right now. Consider new information in terms of its utility, asking, “How is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects?”
2022-09-11
#26
Organizing for action gives you a sense of tremendous clarity, because you know that everything you’re keeping actually has a purpose.
2022-09-11
#27
There is a powerful way to facilitate and speed up this process of rapid association: distill your notes down to their essence. Every idea has an “essence”: the heart and soul of what it is trying to communicate.
2022-09-11
#28
Information becomes knowledge—personal, embodied, verified—only when we put it to use.

Twelve Favorite Problems,
2022-09-11
#51
You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, “How did he do it? He must be a genius!”

Feynman’s approach was to maintain a list of a dozen open questions.

The key to this exercise is to make them open-ended questions that don’t necessarily have a single answer.

It starts with realizing that in any piece of content, the value is not evenly distributed. There are always certain parts that are especially interesting, helpful, or valuable to you.

Curator’s Perspective
2022-09-11
#56
Thinking like a curator means taking charge of your own information stream, instead of just letting it wash over you. The more economical you can be with the material you capture in the first place, the less time and effort your future self will have to spend organizing, distilling, and expressing

Inspiration is one of the most rare and precious experiences in life. It is the essential fuel for doing your best work,
2022-09-11
#58
Sometimes you come across a piece of information that isn’t necessarily inspiring, but you know it might come in handy in the future.
2022-09-11
#59
One of the most valuable kinds of information to keep is personal information
2022-09-11
#60
Claude Shannon, whose discoveries paved the
2022-09-11
#61
way for modern technology, had a simple definition for “information”: that which surprises you.
2022-09-11
#62

Generation Effect,”10 researchers have found that when people actively generate a series of words, such as by speaking or writing, more parts of their brain are activated when compared to simply reading the same words.
2022-09-11
#65
There’s a name for this phenomenon: the Cathedral Effect.2 Studies have shown that the environment we find ourselves in powerfully shapes our thinking.

PARA,I which stands for the four main categories of information in our lives: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives.
2022-09-11
#67
PARA can handle it all, regardless of your profession or field, for one reason: it organizes information based on how actionable it is, not what kind of information it is.
2022-09-11
#68
four categories: Projects: Short-term efforts in your work or life that you’re working on now. Areas: Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time. Resources: Topics or interests that may be useful in the future. Archives: Inactive items from the other three categories.
2022-09-11
#69
Projects have a couple of features that make them an ideal way to organize modern work. First, they have a beginning and an end; they take place during a specific period of time and then they finish. Second, they have a specific, clear outcome that needs to happen in order for them to be checked off as complete, such as “finalize,” “green-light,” “launch,” or “publish.

It doesn’t have a final objective.
2022-09-11

While there is no goal to reach, there is a standard that you want to uphold in each of these areas.

This is basically a catchall for anything that doesn’t belong to a project or an area and could include any topic you’re interested in gathering information about.
2022-09-16
#73
You can also think of them as “research” or “reference materials.”
2022-09-16
#74
These folders are like the class notebooks you probably kept in school: one for biology, another for history, another for math. Any note or file that isn’t relevant or actionable for a current project or area can be placed into resources for future reference.
2022-09-16
#75
This includes any item from the previous three categories that is no longer active.
2022-09-16
#76
Areas have a longer time horizon and are less immediately actionable. Resources may become actionable depending on the situation. Archives remain inactive unless they are needed.
2022-09-16

creating new things is what really matters.
2022-09-17

your notes can survive that journey into the future is their discoverability—how easy it is to discover what they contain and access the specific points that are most immediately useful.
2022-09-17
#81
Progressive Summarization
2022-09-17
#82
The technique is simple: you highlight the main points of a note, and then highlight the main points of those highlights, and so on, distilling the essence of a note in several “layers.” Each of these layers uses a different kind of formatting so you can easily tell them apart.
2022-09-17
#83
This is what I call “layer one”—the chunks of text initially captured in my notes.
2022-09-17
#84
All I have to do is bold the main points within the note.
2022-09-17
#85
second layer of distillation.
2022-09-17
#86
third layer of highlighting. I advise using the “highlighting” feature offered by most notes apps, which paints passages in bright yellow just like the fluorescent highlighters we used in school (which appear in light gray below).
2022-09-17
#87
For only the very few sources that are truly unique and valuable, I’ll add an “executive summary” at the top of the note
2022-09-17
#88
The best sign that a fourth layer is needed is when I find myself visiting a note again and again, clearly indicating that it is one of the cornerstones of my thinking.
2022-09-17
#89
By reviewing this executive summary, I can rapidly recall the main takeaways from this article in a fraction of the time it would take to reread the original.
2022-09-17
#90
Progressive Summarization helps you focus on the content and the presentation of your notes,
2022-09-18
#91
The biggest mistake people make when they start to distill their notes is that they highlight way too much.
2022-09-18
#92
when you’re getting ready to create something.
2022-09-18
#93
Don’t worry about analyzing, interpreting, or categorizing each point to decide whether to highlight it.
2022-09-18
#94
Certain passages will move you, pique your attention, make your heart beat faster, or provoke you. Those are clear signals that you’ve found something important, and it’s time to add a highlight.
2022-09-18

make it easy to find and work with our notes in the future.

There are five kinds of Intermediate Packets you can create and reuse in your work:

interruption-proof because you are focusing only on one small packet at a time,
2022-09-18
#104
make progress in any span of time.
2022-09-18
#105
Intermediate Packets increase the quality of your work by allowing you to collect feedback more often.
2022-09-18
#106
eventually you’ll have so many IPs at your disposal that you can execute entire projects just by assembling previously created IPs.
2022-09-18
#107
The Express step is where we practice and hone our ability to retrieve what we need, when we need
2022-09-18
#108
four methods for retrieval that overlap and complement one another.
2022-09-18
#109
Search Browsing Tags Serendipity
2022-09-18
#110
Search should be the first retrieval method you turn to.
2022-09-18
#111
people strongly prefer to navigate their file systems manually, scanning for the information they’re looking for. Manual navigation gives people control over how they navigate, with folders and file names providing small contextual clues about where to look next.6
2022-09-18
#112
Tags are like small labels you can apply to certain notes regardless of where they are located. Once they are tagged, you can perform a search and see all those notes together in one place.
2022-09-18
#113
Serendipity takes a few different forms when it comes to retrieval.
2022-09-18
#114
First, while using the previous retrieval methods, it is a good idea to keep your focus a little broad.
2022-09-18
#115
Second, serendipity is amplified by visual patterns. This is why I strongly suggest saving not only text notes but images as well (which is difficult to do in other kinds of software such as word processors). Our brains are naturally attuned to visuals.
2022-09-18
#116
Third, sharing our ideas with others introduces a major element of serendipity.
2022-09-18
#117
It is when you begin expressing your ideas and turning your knowledge into action that life really begins to change.
2022-09-18
#118
standardizing the way we work, because we only really improve when we standardize the way we do something.
2022-09-18
#119
A creative endeavor begins with an act of divergence.
2022-09-18
#120
The number of things you are looking at and considering is increasing—you are diverging from your starting point.
2022-09-18
#121
The purpose of divergence is to generate new ideas, so the process is necessarily spontaneous, chaotic, and messy.
2022-09-18
#122
This is the time to wander.
2022-09-18
#123
at some point you must start discarding possibilities and converging toward a solution.
2022-09-18
#124
Convergence forces us to eliminate options, make trade-offs, and decide what is truly essential. It is about narrowing the range of possibilities so that you can make forward progress
2022-09-18
#125
If we overlay the four steps of CODE onto the model of divergence and convergence, we arrive at a powerful template for the creative process in our time.
2022-09-18
#126
The first two steps of CODE, Capture and Organize, make up divergence. They are about gathering seeds of imagination carried on the wind and storing them in a secure place. This is where you research, explore, and add ideas. The final two steps, Distill and Express, are about convergence. They help us shut the door to new ideas and begin constructing something new out of the knowledge building blocks we’ve assembled.
2022-09-18
#127
In divergence mode, you want to open up your horizons and explore every possible option. Open the windows and doors, click every link, jump from one source to another, and let your curiosity be your guide for what to do next.
2022-09-18
#128
input, and ferociously chase the sweet reward of completion.
2022-09-18
#129
If you decide to enter convergence mode, do the opposite: close the door, put on noise-canceling headphones, ignore every new

#130
To create an Archipelago of Ideas, you divergently gather a group of ideas, sources, or points that will form the backbone of your essay, presentation, or deliverable.
2022-09-18
#131
Creating outlines digitally instead of on paper offers multiple major advantages:
2022-09-18
#132
A digital outline is far more malleable and flexible
2022-09-18
#133
The outline can link to more detailed content
2022-09-18
#134
The outline is interactive and multimedia
2022-09-18
#135
The outline is searchable
2022-09-18
#136
The outline can be accessed and edited from anywhere
2022-09-18
#137
An Archipelago of Ideas separates the two activities your brain has the most difficulty performing at the same time: choosing ideas (known as selection) and arranging them into a logical flow (known as sequencing).

Hemingway Bridge.” He would always end a writing session only when he knew what came next in the story. Instead of exhausting every last idea and bit of energy, he would stop when the next plot point became clear.
2022-09-18
#139
You can think of a Hemingway Bridge as a bridge between the islands in your Archipelago of Ideas. You may have the islands, but that is just the first step. The much more challenging work is linking them together into something that makes sense, whether it is a piece of writing, the design of an event, or a business pitch.

The scope refers to the full set of features a software program might include.
2022-09-18
#147
“dial it down” to a more manageable size, and we must if we ever want to see it finished.
2022-09-18

Dialing Down the Scope recognizes that not all the parts of a given project are equally important.
